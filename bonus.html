    <h2> Carl the Chicago Chaser </h2>
    <p> Carl is a large, black, fluffy, and friendly
        moose from the outscurts of Chicago. Growing 
        up he loved to watch baseball with his dad 
        and dreamed of starting his own team, so he 
        created the Chicago Chasers baseball team. As 
        their mascot and creator he wanted a color 
        that showed power and intimidation, so the 
        team's color is black.
